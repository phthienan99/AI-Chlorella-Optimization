# AI-Chlorella-Optimization: A Multi-objective Machine Learning Framework for Sustainable Aquaculture

## Overview
This repository hosts the source code and data processing scripts for the research project presented at the *CITA 2026* conference. The project leverages advanced Machine Learning (ML) techniques to optimize the use of Chlorella vulgaris microalgae for environmental remediation.

**Key Objectives:**
*   Maximize the removal of excess Nitrogen (N) and Phosphorus (P) from aquaculture wastewater.
*   Mitigate the bioaccumulation of heavy metals to safe levels.
*   Ensure the sustainability and safety of harvested biomass for subsequent biofuel production pathways.

## Relevance & National Importance
This research addresses critical global challenges in sustainable agriculture, clean water management, and renewable energy security—topics of substantial merit to the United States environmental policy agenda (e.g., EPA's Clean Water Act and DOE's Bioenergy programs). The methodologies employed here are designed for *scalability* and immediate application in industrial aquaculture settings, demonstrating high potential for national and international impact.

## Project Structure
The repository follows a standard data science layout:
*   `data/`: Raw and processed datasets (CSV files).
*   `src/`: Python source code (`preprocess.py`, `model_training.py`).
*   `notebooks/`: Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) and initial test runs (Jupyter notebooks).
*   `requirements.txt`: List of required Python libraries (e.g., pandas, scikit-learn).

## Getting Started
To replicate this study, first ensure you have a Python environment set up.

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com
    cd AI-Chlorella-Optimization
    ```
2.  **Activate the virtual environment:**
    *   Windows: `venv\Scripts\activate`
    *   macOS/Linux: `source venv/bin/activate`
3.  **Install dependencies:**
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
4.  *Run the main processing script:*
    ```bash
    python src/preprocess.py
    ```
